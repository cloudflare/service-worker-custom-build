# ðŸ‘· `worker-template` Hello World

A template for kick starting a Cloudflare Workers project using custom builds and webpack

* Worker code is in src/. The event handler is in index.js, and the handleRequest method is in
  handleRequest.js, to demonstrate a multi-file project

* The compiled main module is set using the package.json "main" field. This should be set to the
  compiled bundle, in this case dist/worker.js
